            <p><b>Australia</b>, known as "The Land Down Under," is a continent and country 
                renowned for its vast landscapes, diverse wildlife, and vibrant cities. Sydney,
                 with its iconic Opera House and Harbour Bridge, epitomizes Australia's blend of
                  natural beauty and urban sophistication. The Great Barrier Reef, a UNESCO World Heritage Site,
                   attracts divers and nature enthusiasts to explore its kaleidoscope of marine life. Australia's
                    outback offers rugged terrain and ancient rock formations, such as Uluru (Ayers Rock), a sacred
                     site of the indigenous Anangu people. Melbourne captivates with its cultural festivals, art galleries, 
                     and culinary scene, while Brisbane and Perth showcase a laid-back lifestyle amidst stunning coastlines.
