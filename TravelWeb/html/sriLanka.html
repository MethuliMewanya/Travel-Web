            <p><b>Sri Lanka</b>, often called "The Pearl of the Indian Ocean," 
                is a tropical paradise known for its pristine beaches, lush landscapes,
                 and ancient cultural heritage. This island nation off the southern coast
                  of India boasts eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including the ancient
                   city of Sigiriya with its iconic Lion Rock fortress. Visitors are drawn
                    to the sacred city of Kandy, home to the Temple of the Tooth Relic, and
                     the colonial charm of Galle Fort, a testament to Sri Lanka's rich history
                      of trade and conquest. Sri Lanka's natural beauty is showcased in its tea
                       plantations of Nuwara Eliya, wildlife sanctuaries like Yala National Park,
                        and palm-fringed beaches along the southern and eastern coasts. With its warm
                         hospitality, spicy cuisine, and diverse landscapes, Sri Lanka offers a unique
                          blend of relaxation, adventure, and cultural discovery.</p>
